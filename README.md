# DEPRECATED

Craft 3 Multi-Environment has been deprecated; if you still want to use it, you can find it in the [cme-.env.php](https://github.com/nystudio107/craft3-multi-environment/tree/cme-.env.php) branch.

Instead, we suggest using `.env` files as described [Flat Multi-Environment Config for Craft CMS 3](https://nystudio107.com/blog/multi-environment-configuration-for-craft-cms-3) documentation combined with using [Dotenvy](https://github.com/nystudio107/dotenvy) to generate the server configuration.
